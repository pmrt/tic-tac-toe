	STARTING A NEW GAME:
	myGame = new Game();

	==========================================

	CREATING A NEW PLAYER:
	player1 = new Player(<playerid>)

	Where:

		- playerid must be 1 or 2 (the 
		  player number) for handling turns.

	==========================================

	NEW GAME TURN:
	myGame.play(<player obj>, <cell number>)

	Where:

		- player can be 1 or 2.
		- cell can be any value among 1 to 9.

	==========================================

	CREATING A TRACKER:
	t = new Tracker();

	Note. The tracker must be used
	for tracking the game each round.

	==========================================

	CHECKING IF A PLAYER HAVE WON WITH THE TRACKER:
	t.checkPlayer(<game>, <player-to-check>, <rival-player>);
